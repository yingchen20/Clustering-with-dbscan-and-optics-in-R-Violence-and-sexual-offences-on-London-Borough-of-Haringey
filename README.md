# Clustering-with-dbscan-and-optics-in-R-Violence-and-sexual-offences-on-London-Borough-of-Haringey

## Dedicated for the final project of GIS module in 2020

The whole project takes three part: 1) data cleaning, 2) visulization and 3) analysis, 
variables are created in each part, need to run the whole project in order to make sure it runs. 

London boundary data was obtained from London Datastore at https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london,
because it is a megadata, I failed to upload in the repo.
